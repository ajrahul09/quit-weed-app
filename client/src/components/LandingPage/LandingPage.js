                    Our goal is to bring attention to the negative impacts
                    of marijuana on health, mental clarity, appetite, motivation, and more.
                    We are not here to make a moral statement on marijuana usage;
                    plenty of people are able to responsibly enjoy the drug.
                    For those of us who have become addicted, however,
                    the drug quickly takes control of numerous aspects of life.
                    <br /><br />
                    QuitWeed.org is a tool that tracks your journey into sobriety,
                    while monitoring health and emotional improvements along the way.
                    <br /><br />
                    To track these improvements, fill out the survey on the right and
                    check-in to the website daily. In as little as three days
                    you will see withdrawal symptoms recede,
                    and soon you will have your old life back.</p>
